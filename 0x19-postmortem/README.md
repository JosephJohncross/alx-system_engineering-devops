# Outage Summary:

Date: April 12, 2024
Duration: 3 hours (10:00 AM EDT - 1:00 PM EDT)
Impact: 30% decrease in user engagement due to intermittent connection errors and slow response times for the flagship web application.
Root Cause: Misconfigured load balancer settings led to uneven traffic distribution and overloading of backend servers.

## Timeline:

10:00 AM EDT: Automated monitoring detected increased error rates and latency.
10:05 AM EDT: Infrastructure team investigated unusual server CPU utilization, initially focusing on backend database servers.
10:45 AM EDT: Investigation shifted to the load balancer configuration after observing traffic distribution inconsistencies.
11:45 AM EDT: Incident escalated as initial troubleshooting paths (network bandwidth & firewall rules) yielded no results.
12:00 PM EDT: Engineers identified a recent load balancer configuration update as a potential cause.
12:30 PM EDT: Misconfigured settings reverted, restoring normal traffic distribution.
1:00 PM EDT: Web application availability and performance recovered.

## Resolution & Prevention:

#Immediate Fix: Reverted load balancer configuration to previous state.

## Corrective Actions:

Implement automated load balancer configuration validation.
Enhance monitoring for granular insights into traffic distribution and server utilization.

## Preventative Measures:

 Review recent configuration changes.
Develop a load balancer rollback procedure.
Schedule regular load balancer configuration audits.
This incident highlights the importance of robust monitoring and configuration management practices. The implemented improvements will strengthen the system's reliability and prevent similar outages in the future.
